# Singing Syllabi with Virtual Avatars: Enhancing Student Engagement Through AI-Generated Music and Digital Embodiment

In practical teaching, we observe that few students thoroughly read or fully comprehend the information provided in traditional, text-based course syllabi. As a result, essential details, such as course policies and learning outcomes, are frequently overlooked. To address this challenge, in this paper, we proposed a novel approach leveraging AI-generated singing and virtual avatars to present syllabi in a format that is more visually appealing, engaging, and memorable. Especially, we leveraged the open-source tool, HeyGem, to transform textual syllabi into audiovisual presentations, in which digital avatars perform the syllabus content as songs. The proposed approach aims to stimulate studentsâ€™ curiosity, foster emotional connection, and enhance retention of critical course information. Student feedback indicated that AI-sung syllabi significantly improved awareness and recall of key course information.
